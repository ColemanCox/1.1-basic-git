<p> My name is Coleman Cox,my email address is<ahref> www.gmail.com</a>colezane82@gmail.com and I joined TIY because I wanted to enter a career field that I enjoy.  After reading an article about TIY, I decided that it sounded like something that I could make a career of.   Like they say,"If you want something you've never had before; you're gonna have to do something you've never done before."</p>
