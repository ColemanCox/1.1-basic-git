    <p>..........    Hello, all.  My name is Coleman Zane Cox and I wanna be somebody, someday.(You can bet your hard-earned dollar I will lol). After roughly 10 hours of Iron Yard class, I can already tell that this is going to take some fight to attain and then surpass my own personal expectations.  Wish me success...
